# QTWordShuffle
Created for COP 3003, Programming II FGCU 2023.

A version of my Word Shuffle game for Windows Desktop made with Qt Creator with C++ and CMake.



Goal:  
A word game for windows which shows the definition of a word and scrambled letters. 
The objective is to figure out the word and rearrange the letters into the correct order by dragging them into the appropriate positions.
 
Current Status:  
All major logic and functionality is completed. From here only UI/UX work left.

As of last update:  
Red arrow button labeled skip is visible when first presented with a word challenge. 
If solved correctly, red arrow goes away and a green arrow appears. 

Next Steps:  
Add UI/UX elements informing the user they are correct.
Will show user what the last word was.
Add a Reset button that moves the letters to the original positions.
Keep track of the number of solved vs skipped challenges.
Add a welcome screen.
Remove visible correct answer in the "Hint" section.


## Process

This is built with Qt Creator, CMake, and C++

## Purpose
This was created for a C++ programming class. 
Since I built a version of this application for Android in Java, this was an opportunity for me to learn
about the language differences and see which aspects of development carry over and which need to be done differently.

Since this a GUI with visual elements that need to be updated and destroyed I figured it would give me the opportunity to 
work with many of the aspects that differentiate C++ from Java, specifically in terms of object construction and memory management.
