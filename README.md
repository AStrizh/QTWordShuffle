# QTWordShuffle
Created for COP 3003, Programming II FGCU 2023.

A version of my Word Shuffle game for Windows Desktop made with Qt Creator with C++ and CMake.

## Description

The objective is to figure out the word and rearrange the letters into the correct order by dragging them into the appropriate positions.  
A challenge word is generated by the system, it's letters are scrambled. A definition for the word is given as a hint.  
Occasionally, by random chance, letters could be scrabled to their proper positions, this is intentional because I thought it was funny and is true to randomness.    

A red skip button is initially available allowing the user to skip the challenge, the user will be informed what the challenge word was in a text label at the bottom. 
A reset button moves all the letters back to their original spots. This is useful if the user just wants to start over.
If all the letters are placed correctly the skip and reset buttons disappear and the green next button becomes available.

If two letters are placed into the same target, the previous letter goes back to its original spot.

Features not completed in time:
There is no welcome screen (splash screen). While I planned to make one early in the development I wanted to make sure all the functionality was working first. 
Unfortunately, I ran out of time to add it.
There is no score keeping system. Nothing keeps track of a user's performance. 
It would be desirable to give the user some visual confirmation they are right besides the green arrow, 
and to increase difficulty over time, for that "skinner box" effect.

One idea is to add a timer and see how many words can be solved in the time (like 5 minutes).  
It would also be great to add a more colorful background.

Goal:  
Make a functional word game for windows built with C++

Current Status:  
All major logic and functionality is completed.
Lacks a Welcome screen. 
Red arrow button labeled skip is visible when first presented with a word challenge.   
If solved correctly, red arrow goes away and a green arrow appears.   
Will show user what the last word was.    
A Reset button moves the letters to the original positions.  


As of last update:  
Comments were added for all major components of the project

Next Steps:  
Add a welcome screen.  
Keep track of the number of solved vs skipped challenges.   
Make the buttons do things when interacted with, as a user would expect.


## Process

This is built with Qt Creator, CMake, and C++.
The word challenges are stored in an SQLite Database, which is included (word.db). 
If you are building the project, make sure the database is in the build folder. 
That means you must initially build it (you will have errors), then place the database into that build folder.

NOTE: The author does not give permission to use word.db outside of this application. 

## Purpose
This was created for a C++ programming class. 
Since I built a version of this application for Android in Java, this was an opportunity for me to learn
about the language differences and see which aspects of development carry over and which need to be done differently.

Since this a GUI with visual elements that need to be updated and destroyed I figured it would give me the opportunity to 
work with many of the aspects that differentiate C++ from Java, specifically in terms of object construction and memory management.
